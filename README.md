My name is Sukin Vickram A V, and I am currently pursuing my studies at IIT Madras. I am from Namakkal, and I was brought up in Chennai. Beyond academics, I like playing badminton, watching movies, and solving programming problems.
The feature I like most about git is that it has Distributed Version Control.
The python assignment which i enjoyed the most was the one which had asked to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
